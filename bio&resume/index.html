              I am a senior about to graduate from Eastern Washington University with a degree in computer science and a minor in web application development.

                During my time at EWU I worked for the Tech department almost the entire time.  I began working as an Office of Information Technology Help Desk employee near the end of my first year at EWU.  Halfway through my Sophomore year I was promoted to OIT Student Assistant.  This meaning that I was a personal assistant to one of the full time IT Professional workers.  About half way through Winter quarter of my senior year I was picked for an internship doing web development at a company in downtown Spokane called Mojo Lab.  This internship will lead into full time employment.  My specialty resides is back end work mainly with Javascript and PHP.
